Unity Project to show how FPS mechanics works.
Features of the project include:
  1) Mouse lock
  2) Keyboard input for movement (WASD)
  3) Cross-hair
  4) Kill Enemies (in RED)
  5) Step on Obstacles (in GREEN)
  6) Jump
  7) Shoot
  8) Reload
  9) SFX sounds with each action

*Note: Scoping on enemy (using right click), is not working. I have tried many methods.
There is some problem with the vector addition.
